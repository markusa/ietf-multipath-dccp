	<abstract><t>
   DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per
   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
   simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
   improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
   experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
   network failure.</t>

	<t>
   Multipath DCCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple
   paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to
   traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers
   the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
   components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
   potentially disjoint paths. Add a sentence. </t>

	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to regular DCCP
   <xref target="RFC4340"/>, which enables a transport connection to operate across
   multiple paths simultaneously.  DCCP multipath operations is
   suggested in the context of ongoing 3GPP work on 5G multi-access
   solutions <xref target="I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp"/> and for
   hybrid access networks <xref target="I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture"/><xref target="I-D.muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access"/>.  It
   can be applied for load-balancing, seamless session handover and
   aggregation purposes (referred to as steering, switching and
   splitting in 3GPP terminology <xref target="TR23.793"/>).</t>

	<t>
   This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
   capability to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
   multiple paths ("subflows"), managing these subflows, reassembly of
   data, and termination of sessions.</t>

	<section title="Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack" anchor="section-1.1"><t>
   MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
   both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
   top of standard DCCP; Figure 1 illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
   designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
   changes.</t>

	<section title="Differences from Multipath TCP" anchor="section-1.4"><t>
   Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP <xref target="RFC6824"/>, in that it
   extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol <xref target="RFC4340"/> with
   multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
   <xref target="RFC0793"/>.  However, mainly dominated by the basic protocols TCP and
   DCPP, the transport characteristics are different.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="table_tcp_dccp_comp"></xref> compares the protocol characteristics of TCP and DCCP, which
   are by nature inherited by their respective multipath extensions.  A
   major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which is for TCP an
   exact copy of the generated byte-stream.  DCCP behaves contrary and
   does not guarantee to transmit any payload nor the order of delivery.
   Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a TCP or
   DCCP communication, many similarities on sender side can be stated.
   Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation of a
   communication and both exploit a congestion control to adapt to path
   characteristics.</t>

	<t>
   Consequently, the multipath features, shown in <xref target="table_mptpc_mpdccp_comp"></xref>, are the same
   for support of volatile paths, session handover and path aggregation
   capabilities.  All of them profit by the existence of congestion
   control.</t>

	<texttable style="all" title="MPTCP and MP-DCCP protocol comparison" anchor="table_mptpc_mpdccp_comp"><ttcol>Feature</ttcol>

	</texttable>

	<t>
   Therefore the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
   MPTCP, even if the multipath session initiation differs.  MP-DCCP
   inherits a robust session establishment feature, which guarantees
   communication establishment if at least one functional path is
   available.  MP-TCP relies on an initial path, which has to work;
   otherwise no communication can be established.</t>

	<t>
   The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable
   transport character of DCCP and a possible re-assembly of the data
   stream.  In practice, it is assumed that some sort of re-assembly has
   to be applied, even if DCCP and the order of delivery is unreliable
   by nature.  Such re-assembly mechanisms have to account for the fact
   that packet loss may occur for any of the DCCP subflows.  Another
   issue is the packet reordering introduced when a DCCP communication
   is split across paths with disjoint latencies.  In theory,
   applications using DCCP certainly have to deal with packet
   reordering, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.  However, in
   practice, without any multipath extension, packet reordering can be
   assumed to be very limited.  Therefore most services on top of DCCP
   are not expecting massive packet reordering and degrades their
   performance if it happens anyway.</t>

	<t>
   The receiving process for MP-TCP is on the other hand a simple "just wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.</t>
